We only know if this works if your SF PR is merged, as the class `FileLinkFormatter` doesn't exists yet :)
(maybe add a utest for this change?)

I supposed @jeremyFreeAgent tested it manually, right?

Yes I needed to test it manually since the dependencies are not merged yet. If the `FileLinkFormatter` is not here, it fallbacks on the previous one.

I've pushed the changes to reflect the ones made in the Symfony PR.
